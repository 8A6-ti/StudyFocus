# StudyFocus
A Windows application to help you focus on your studies
Windows only for now, we have to focus on the more important things in this current stage.
## What is this?
Made for the VinSTEAM Innovation competition, this project aims to help users focus on their studies by limiting their access to applications using a Python "system controller" and an Electron UI. You can start a studying session then add your objectives, total studying time, total rest time, allowed apps and once the session is over it uploads your progress to a website (planned) for you to share to your friends & family, etc
## How to run (Latest commits)
Download or clone the repository then install all requirements from the Python main.py file and install Electron using NPM. Latest commits usually don't have the Python system controller built-in into the Electron app so run both ```npm start``` and ```py main.py```
## Major todos
- Vietnamese language support (multi language support in general)
- Advanced time allocation
- Finish menu during study mode
- Polish and clean up UI
- Website for handling users, session history (planned)
- Point system like Duolingo (planned)
- Unix (Linux and MacOS) support (We don't have Macs, lets hope Unix support in general works for both)
# Project actively in development, expect some bugs and unfinished code, UX
