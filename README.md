# StudyFocus
A Windows application to help you focus on your studies
Windows only for now, we have to focus on the more important things in this current stage.
## What is this?
Made for the VinSTEAM Innovation competition, this project aims to help users focus on their studies by limiting their access to applications using a Python "system controller" and an Electron UI. You can start a studying session then add your objectives, total studying time, total rest time, allowed apps and once the session is over it uploads your progress to a website (planned) for you to share to your friends & family, etc
# Project actively in development, expect some bugs and unfinished code, UX
